# VLBI notebook
This is a Jupyter notebook that walks through the setup and solution of the inverse problem described in [Chael et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07088). This notebook is for my personal learning, and all credit for the techniques involved goes to the authors of the paper.

For convenience, I have included the model and telescope array data available from the Andrew Chael's [eht-imaging](https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging) repository, though you'll need to install that library as well. Code taken from `ehtim` is credited in the Jupyter notebook.

## Dependencies
To use this package, you'll need

* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* ehtim
